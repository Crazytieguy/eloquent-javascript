# Programming Language
This is my take on [chapter 12 of Eloquent Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/12_language.html)

I implemented a simple lisp called CrazyTies.

You can try it out on [Github Pages](https://crazytieguy.github.io/eloquent-javascript/12_language/)

It can also be run with node
`node ct.js <filename>`
