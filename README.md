# Eloquent Javascript
My attempt at completing project chapters from [Eloquent JS](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)

I try to implement as much as I can before looking at the books' implementation, and add interesting bits to the projects ðŸ™‚

This project is hosted on github pages, and the chapters I've decided to implement a front end for can be viewed there. For example [07_robot](https://crazytieguy.github.io/eloquent-javascript/07_robot/)
